# Silent-Disco-Glamping-Network

An optimisation framework for selecting remote glamping locations that maximise geographic dispersion under cost, capacity, and minimum-separation constraints. The problem is solved using Outer Approximation after a concave perspective reformulation of a fractional objective.

This is originally created as a project submission to Mathematical Optimisation: Theory and Application, AMSI summer School 2026.
