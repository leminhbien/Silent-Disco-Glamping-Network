# Silent-Disco-Glamping-Network

This repository represents an optimisation framework for selecting remote glamping locations that maximise geographic dispersion under cost, capacity, and minimum-separation constraints. The problem is solved using Outer Approximation after a concave perspective reformulation of a fractional objective.

The full methodology and computational results are demonstrated in the Jupyter notebook **`Silent Disco Glamping Network.ipynb`**, accompanied by a detailed technical report (**`Technical Write-up.pdf`**). The repository also includes the associated dataset **`au_airports.csv`** (from https://ourairports.com/countries/AU/), the original project brief from the AMSI Summer School 2026, and the module **`Linearisationtechnique.py`** (developed by Dr Hoa Bui).

This is originally created as a project submission to Mathematical Optimisation: Theory and Application, AMSI Summer School 2026.
